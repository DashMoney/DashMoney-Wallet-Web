# DashMoney Wallet Web Frontend

## React + Vite

**This is a short description of how someone would operate this frontend.**

1. Copy this github repository to your own github account.
2. Connect copied Github repository to hosting service (Vercel - I use Hobby-free edition).
3. Add environment variables and domain name to hosting service.
   â€¢ See Below\*
4. Hosting service builds and deploys.

\*These are the environmental variable that you need to create for operation:

- VITE_FRONTEND_NAME = DashMoney
- VITE_BKGD = dark

_Frontend Name is what will appear in the top of page navigation bar._
_BKGD is 'Background' which can be dark or primary_
